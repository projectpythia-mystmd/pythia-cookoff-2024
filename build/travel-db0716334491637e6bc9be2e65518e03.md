### How?

#### Full Travel Support

Register for in-person attendance by **March 29** to receive consideration for full travel support, including airfare, lodging, and local food and travel expenses.
To be considered, the application will request some additional information from you, including four brief prompts about how support might benefit your personal and professional goals.
If you are requesting travel support, the registration will provide you with a temporary fee waiver coupon code to complete your full registration.
You will be notified of award for full travel support by **April 8**.


#### Partial Travel Support

Register for in-person attendance by **May 3** to receive consideration for partial travel support.
This can cover smaller expenses like local gas costs or registration fee waivers.
Partial travel support will be offered as-available after fully supported travel allocations are sent out.
If you apply for fully supported travel and do not receive a full award, you will automatically be considered for partial travel support.
You will be notified for award of partial travel support by **May 13**.

If you request either form of travel support and receive neither, you will be contacted to finalize your registration with payment of fee before registration deadline.
